00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.820
"But it's too late now"

2
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.220
"I remember you and me"

3
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.220
"And how careless we could be"

4
00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.180
all day

5
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:16.480
and all night

6
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.460
we'd stay up

7
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.900
it felt so right

8
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.440
we were so young

9
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:22.940
we were so dumb

10
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.620
we would get drunk

11
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.280
and then hook up

12
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.740
we were ok

13
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:29.060
we were alright

14
00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:30.540
stayin awake

15
00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:32.340
till the sun rise

16
00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.060
we were in love

17
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.540
couldn't stop us

18
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.000
like a good drug

19
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:38.580
never enough

20
00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.320
we'd hook up in my car

21
00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:41.520
drive it so far

22
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.320
play you guitar

23
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.140
you'd show me ur art

24
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.720
let down our guards

25
00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:48.460
think with our hearts

26
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.800
Stare at the stars

27
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.260
we were never apart

28
00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:52.960
drinking too young

29
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.700
way too much fun

30
00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.140
out in the sun

31
00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.920
or in when it's gone

32
00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.480
took you to prom

33
00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:00.980
dance to our song

34
00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.600
dance all night long

35
00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.380
till the lights come on

36
00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.820
but it's too late now

37
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.260
I remember everything

38
00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.780
and how careless we could be

39
00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.460
but it's too late now

40
00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.200
I remember you and me

41
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.060
and how careless we could be

42
00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.580
it's too late now

43
00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:38.440
I remember everything

44
00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.480
and how careless we could be

45
00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.620
and how careless we could be

46
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.920
and how careless we could be

47
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.500
and how careless we could be

48
00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.440
and how careless we could be

49
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.000
late nights

50
00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:24.500
long fights

51
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:25.900
it felt right

52
00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.460
we were alive

53
00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.060
we would go out

54
00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:30.700
we were so loud

55
00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:32.220
we were so proud

56
00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:33.840
we had no doubts

57
00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:35.580
weekends

58
00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.080
and week days

59
00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:38.740
we'd spend

60
00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.400
our own way

61
00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:41.880
we were careless

62
00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.540
we were fearless

63
00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.980
we were reckless

64
00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:46.920
time was precious

65
00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.420
we loved to waste time

66
00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:49.820
whiskey and wine

67
00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.300
drinking all night

68
00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.180
asleep by your side

69
00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.700
finally alive

70
00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.260
we would just drive

71
00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:57.760
never arrive

72
00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.540
our journey was life

73
00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.160
staying out late

74
00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.460
testing our faith

75
00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.340
running away

76
00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:05.960
we lived for today

77
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.660
young and so bold

78
00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.160
never get old

79
00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:10.760
screw what we're told

80
00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.520
we can't be controlled!

81
00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.980
but it's too late now

82
00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.380
I remember everything

83
00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.760
and how careless we could be

84
00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.520
but it's too late now

85
00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.100
I remember you and me

86
00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.920
and how careless we could be

87
00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.340
it's too late now

88
00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:46.140
I remember everything

89
00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.260
and how careless we could be

90
00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.560
and how careless we could be

91
00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.800
and how careless we could be

92
00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.720
and how careless we could be

93
00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.420
and how careless we could be

94
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.960
and how careless we could be

95
00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.460
it's too late now

96
00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.880
I remember you and me

97
00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:55.220
and how careless we could be
